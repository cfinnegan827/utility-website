                <p>When we where at the bruins game when we brought everyone I was so nervous to
                talk to you. Its funny to look back on but I liked you so much that whenevr I went
                to go speak my heart would skip a beat and my mind would go blank. Then when
                I put my arm around you I would want to say all my troubles went away but all it made
                me realize was that I really needed to step up my game and I couldn't be nervous, it didnt work
                and I was still nervous, but thankfully enough it worked.</p>

                  On Febuary 9th when we went to go play pool at the pool hall and it was just us in there.
                  It was onhe of the best times we have hung out because we where both so giggly, and I wont
                  lie I was definelty being a little touchy to throw you off your game and I would like
                  to think it worked, and I definelty did not pick the right clothes that day either.

                  When we went to the interactive musuem with Sandra, Alexi, and Juvier I was so nervous because this was the first time interacting with
                  people in your family more than small talk. I was so so nervous I didn't know what to wear and wanted to make a good impression. After we
                  both got home from the musuem and we where texting you told me you noticed that i fidget with my hands when I get nervous. No one has ever
                  pointed that out to me before, and I've been doing it for the majority of my life. It made me realize that you where someone who I could be honest with
                  and it made me like you even more than I already did(which is very hard to do since I like you an unmeasurable amount)

                  When we went to muse to paint and before you started you smiled at me and told me that it wasn't a competition. It was cute and adorable because
                  I think we both knew deep down no matter how many times we said that we where going to compare at the end. But that night painting with you was so much
                  fun and I just love doing all these things with you.

                  I never know if you notice or not but I always try and wake up early on the days you have work and I am not already up. I set my alarm for 7:30
                  and 7:45 so I can text you before you head into work. Even though by that time you have already texted me first that morning. I also always try and ask
                  if you are covering lunch when you work because I try and eat at the same time you do. Its just something small I like doing to make sure I dont miss
                  youre brreak from work.

                  You have always been so kind whenever we go out, not just to me but to everyone else as well. I never know how to show how grateful I am for your kindness
                  especially when you get me things because no one has ever been kind enough to think of me like that before. I wish I could find a way to repay you
                  but it will never be enough for how kind you really are.
